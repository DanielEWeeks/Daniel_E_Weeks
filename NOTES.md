# Constructing a Research Group Website

Here's a nice one from today's Biostats Seminar speaker that looks like it works well both on desktop computers and on my cell phone: 

     <https://mzhanglab.github.io/>	  

It uses this template code: 

<https://github.com/sbryngelson/academic-website-template>


# Step 1

Log into GitHub in your web browser.

Go to 

<https://github.com/sbryngelson/academic-website-template>

and click the "Use this template" button and choose the 'Create a new repository' option.


To customize it with my own information, I had to modify these files and update some image
files:
	 
   _config.yml
   _data/funders.yml
   _data/pi.yml
   _pages/home.md
   images/DanWeeks_WordCloud.png
   images/headshot.jpg
