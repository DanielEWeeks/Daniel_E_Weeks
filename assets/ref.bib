	title = {Improving imputation quality in {Samoans} through the integration of population-specific sequences into existing reference panels},
	doi = {10.1101/2023.10.31.23297835},
	abstract = {Genotype imputation is fundamental to association studies, and yet even gold standard panels like TOPMed are limited in the populations for which they yield good imputation. Specifically, Pacific Islanders are poorly represented in extant panels. To address this, we constructed an imputation reference panel using 1,285 Samoan individuals with whole-genome sequencing, combined with 1000 Genomes (1000G) samples, to create a reference panel that better represents Pacific Islander, specifically Samoan, genetic variation. We compared this panel to 1000G and TOPMed panels based on imputed variants using genotyping array data for 1,834 Samoan participants who were not part of the panels. The 1000G + 1285 Samoan panel yielded up to 2.25-2.76 times more well-imputed (r 2 ≥ 0.80) variants than TOPMed and 1000G. There was improved imputation accuracy across the minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum, although it was more pronounced for variants with 0.01 ≤ MAF ≤ 0.05. Imputation accuracy (r 2 ) was greater for population-specific variants (high fixation index, F ST ) and those from larger haplotypes (high LD score). The gain in imputation accuracy over TOPMed was largest for small haplotypes (low LD score), reflecting the Samoan panel's ability to capture population-specific variation not well tagged by other panels. We also augmented the 1000G reference panel with varying numbers of Samoan samples and found that panels with 48 or more Samoans included outperformed TOPMed for all variants with MAF ≥ 0.001. This study identifies variants with improved imputation using population-specific reference panels and provides a framework for constructing other population-specific reference panels.},

	issn = {1520-6300},
	doi = {10.1002/ajhb.23838},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In 1999, a set of highly accurate Polynesian-specific equations to estimate adult body fat from non-invasive field measures of age, sex, height, and weight (Equation 1), age, sex, height, weight, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) resistance (Equation 2), and age, sex, height, weight, and the sum of two skinfold thicknesses (Equation 3) were published. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the equation-based estimators in a sample of Samoan adults recruited 20 years later between 2017 and 2019.
METHODS: Age, sex, height, weight, BIA resistance, skinfold thickness, and fat mass as measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were available for 432 Samoan adults (mean age 50.9 years, 56% female) seen in 2017/2019. We compared equation-derived fat mass and DXA-derived fat mass using scatterplots and Pearson correlation coefficients. We then updated the equation coefficient estimates in a training set (2/3 of the sample) and evaluated the performance of the updated equations in a testing set (the remaining 1/3 of the sample).
RESULTS: Equation-derived fat mass was strongly correlated with DXA-derived fat mass for Equation (1) (r2  = 0.95, n = 432), Equation (2) (r2  = 0.97, n = 425), and Equation (3) (r2  = 0.95, n = 426). Updating the equation coefficient estimates resulted in mostly similar coefficients and nearly identical testing set performance for Equation (1) (r2  = 0.96, n = 153), Equation (2) (r2  = 0.98, n = 150), and Equation (3) (r2  = 0.96, n = 150).
CONCLUSIONS: The Polynesian-specific body fat estimation equations remained stable despite changing social and environmental factors and marked increase in obesity prevalence in Samoa.},

	volume = {30},
	issn = {1930-739X},
	doi = {10.1002/oby.23559},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand whether the paradoxical association of missense variant rs373863828 in CREB3 regulatory factor (CREBRF) with higher BMI but lower odds of diabetes is explained by either metabolically favorable body fat distribution or greater fat-free mass.
METHODS: This study explored the association of the minor allele with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition in n = 421 Samoans and used path analysis to examine the mediating role of fat and fat-free mass on the relationship between rs373863828 and fasting glucose.
RESULTS: Among females, the rs373863828 minor A allele was associated with greater BMI. There was no association of genotype with percent body fat, visceral adiposity, or fat distribution in either sex. In both females and males, lean mass was greater with each A allele: 2.16 kg/copy (p = 0.0001) and 1.73 kg/copy (p = 0.02), respectively. Path analysis showed a direct negative effect of rs373863828 genotype on fasting glucose (p = 0.004) consistent with previous findings, but also an indirect positive effect on fasting glucose operating through fat-free mass (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of rs373863828 in CREBRF, common among Pacific Islanders, on type 2 diabetes does not operate through body composition. Rather, the variant's effects on body size/composition and fasting glucose likely operate via different, tissue-specific mechanisms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data archiving and distribution are essential to scientific rigor and reproducibility of research. The National Center for Biotechnology Information's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) is a public repository for scientific data sharing. To support curation of thousands of complex data sets, dbGaP has detailed submission instructions that investigators must follow when archiving their data.
RESULTS: We developed dbGaPCheckup, an R package which implements a series of check, awareness, reporting, and utility functions to support data integrity and proper formatting of the subject phenotype data set and data dictionary prior to dbGaP submission. For example, as a tool, dbGaPCheckup ensures that the data dictionary contains all fields required by dbGaP, and additional fields required by dbGaPCheckup; the number and names of variables match between the data set and data dictionary; there are no duplicated variable names or descriptions; observed data values are not more extreme than the logical minimum and maximum values stated in the data dictionary; and more. The package also includes functions that implement a series of minor/scalable fixes when errors are detected (e.g., a function to reorder the variables in the data dictionary to match the order listed in the data set). Finally, we also include reporting functions that produce graphical and textual descriptives of the data to further reduce the likelihood of data integrity issues. The dbGaPCheckup R package is available on CRAN ( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dbGaPCheckup ) and developed on GitHub ( https://github.com/lwheinsberg/dbGaPCheckup ).
CONCLUSION: dbGaPCheckup is an innovative assistive and timesaving tool that fills an important gap for researchers by making dbGaP submission of large and complex data sets less error prone.},

However, previous small studies of people of Polynesian ancestries have failed to replicate the association. In this study, we used Bayesian meta-analysis to test rs9939609, the most replicated FTO variant, for association with BMI with a large sample (n = 6095) of Aotearoa New Zealanders of Polynesian (Māori and Pacific) ancestry and of Samoan people living in the Independent State of Samoa and in American Samoa. We did not observe statistically significant association within each separate Polynesian subgroup. Bayesian meta-analysis of the Aotearoa New Zealand Polynesian and Samoan samples resulted in a posterior mean effect size estimate of +0.21 kg/m2, with a 95% credible interval [+0.03 kg/m2, +0.39 kg/m2]. While the Bayes Factor (BF) of 0.77 weakly favors the null, the BF = 1.4 Bayesian support interval is [+0.04, +0.20].

	abstract = {Background
              While preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of pregnancy-related morbidity/mortality, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a dynamic regulator of gene expression that may offer insight into PE pathophysiology and/or serve as a biomarker (e.g., risk, subtype, a therapeutic response). This study’s purpose was to evaluate for differences in blood-based DNAm across all trimesters between individuals eventually diagnosed with PE (cases) and individuals who remained normotensive throughout pregnancy, did not develop proteinuria, and birthed a normally grown infant (controls).
            
Results
              In the discovery phase, longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated across three trimesters of pregnancy in 56 participants (n=28 cases, n=28 controls) individually matched on self-identified race, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, and gestational age at sample collection. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was conducted, using surrogate variable analysis to account for unwanted sources of variation. No CpGs met the genome-wide significance p value threshold of 9×10^-8, but 16 CpGs (trimester 1: 5; trimester 2: 1; trimester 3: 10) met the suggestive significance threshold of 1×10^-5. DNAm data were also evaluated for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by PE status. Three DMRs in each trimester were significant after Bonferonni-adjustment. Since only third-trimester samples were available from an independent replication sample (n=64 cases,n=50 controls), the top suggestive hits from trimester 3 (cg16155413 and cg21882990 associated with TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2 genes, which also made up the top DMR) were carried forward for replication. During replication, DNAm data were also generated for validation purposes from discovery phase third trimester samples. While significant associations between DNAm and PE status were observed at both sites in the validation sample, no associations between DNAm and PE status were observed in the independent replication sample.
                          
Conclusions
              The discovery phase findings for cg16155413/cg21882990 (TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2) were validated with a new platform but were not replicated in an independent sample. Given the differences in participant characteristics between the discovery and replication samples, we cannot rule out important signals for these CpGs. Additional research is warranted for cg16155413/cg21882990, as well as top hits in trimesters 1–2 and significant DMRs that were not examined in the replication phase.},

A novel contribution is our creation of an open access web-based application, the BDNF DNA Methylation Map, to interactively visualize specific positions of CpG sites investigated across all studies for which relevant data were available. Our literature search of four databases through September 27, 2021 returned 1701 articles, of which 153 met inclusion criteria. Our review revealed exceptional heterogeneity in methodological approaches, hindering the identification of clear patterns of robust and/or replicated results.

Of the 40 PFAS analytes tested, 19 were detected in cord blood, with 10 detected in {\textgreater}50\% of samples (PFBA, PFPeA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFTrDA, PFHxS, PFOS, and 9Cl-PF3ONS); and 12 analytes were detected in DBS, with 3 detected in {\textgreater}50\% of samples (PFBA, PFHxS, and PFOS). PFAS concentrations were generally lower than those reported in existing literature, with the exception of PFHxS, which was detected at higher concentrations. In cord blood, we noted suggestive (p {\textless} 0.05) or significant (p {\textless} 0.006) associations between higher PFHxS and male sex; higher PFPeA and residence in Northwest 'Upolu (NWU) compared to the Apia Urban Area (AUA); lower PFUnA and 9Cl-PF3ONS and greater socioeconomic resources; lower PFOA and higher parity; higher PFDA and higher maternal age; and lower PFUnA, PFTrDA, and 9Cl-PF3ONS and higher maternal BMI. In DBS, we found suggestive (p {\textless} 0.05) or significant (p {\textless} 0.025) associations between lower PFBA and residence in NWU versus AUA; lower PFBA and PFHxS and higher maternal age; and higher PFBA and higher maternal BMI. Finally, we observed associations between nutrition source at 4 months and DBS PFBA and PFHxS, with formula- or mixed-fed infants having higher concentrations compared to exclusively breastfed infants. This study represents the first characterization of PFAS contamination in Samoa. Additional work in larger samples is needed to identify potentially modifiable determinants of PFAS concentrations, information that is critical for informing environmental and health policy measures.},

	abstract = {Background The A allele of rs373863828 in CREB3 regulatory factor is associated with high Body Mass Index, but lower odds of type 2 diabetes. These associations have been replicated elsewhere, but to date all studies have been cross-sectional. Our aims were (1) to describe the development of type 2 diabetes and change in fasting glucose between 2010 and 2018 among a longitudinal cohort of adult Samoans without type 2 diabetes or who were not using diabetes medications at baseline, and (2) to examine associations between fasting glucose rate-of-change (mmol/L per year) and the A allele of rs373863828. Methods We describe and test differences in fasting glucose, the development of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, age, smoking status, physical activity, urbanicity of residence, and household asset scores between 2010 and 2018 among a cohort of n = 401 adult Samoans, selected to have a {\textasciitilde}2:2:1 ratio of GG:AG: AA rs373863828 genotypes. Multivariate linear regression was used to test whether fasting glucose rate-of-change was associated with rs373863828 genotype, and other baseline variables. Results By 2018, fasting glucose and BMI significantly increased among all genotype groups, and a substantial portion of the sample developed type 2 diabetes mellitus. The A allele was associated with a lower fasting glucose rate-of-change (β = −0.05 mmol/L/year per allele, p = 0.058 among women; β = −0.004 mmol/L/year per allele, p = 0.863 among men), after accounting for baseline variables. Mean fasting glucose and mean BMI increased over an eight-year period and a substantial number of individuals developed type 2 diabetes by 2018. However, fasting glucose rate-of-change, and type 2 diabetes development was lower among females with AG and AA genotypes. Conclusions Further research is needed to understand the effect of the A allele on fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes development. Based on our observations that other risk factors increased over time, we advocate for the continued promotion for diabetes prevention and treatment programming, and the reduction of modifiable risk factors, in this setting.},

	abstract = {Sleep apnea is a global public health concern, but little research has examined this issue in low- and middle-income countries, including Samoa. The purpose of this study was to examine the sample prevalence and characteristics of sleep apnea using a validated home sleep apnea device (WatchPAT, Itamar) and explore factors that may influence sleep health in the Samoan setting. This study used data collected through the Soifua Manuia (“Good Health”) study, which investigated the impact of the body mass index (BMI)-associated genetic variant rs373863828 in CREBRF on metabolic traits in Samoan adults (sampled to overrepresent the obesity-risk allele of interest). A total of 330 participants had sleep data available. Participants (53.3% female) had a mean (SD) age of 52.0 (9.9) years and BMI of 35.5 (7.5) kg/m2, and 36.3\% of the sample had type 2 diabetes. Based on the 3% and 4% apnea hypopnea indices (AHI) and the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI), descriptive analyses revealed moderate to severe sleep apnea (defined as >=15 events/hr) in 54.9%, 31.5%, and 34.5% of the sample, respectively. Sleep apnea was more severe in men (e.g., AHI 3% ≥15 in 61.7% of men and 48.9% of women). Correction for non-representational sampling related to the CREBRF obesity-risk allele resulted in only slightly lower estimates. Multiple linear regression linked a higher number of events/hr to higher age, male sex, higher BMI, higher abdominal-hip circumference ratio, and geographic region of residence. Further research and an increased focus on equitable and affordable diagnosis and access to treatment are crucial to addressing sleep apnea in Samoa and globally.},

	abstract = {In the era of precision health, nursing research has increasingly focused on the analysis of large, multidimensional data sets containing multiple correlated phenotypes (e.g., symptoms). This presents challenges for statistical analyses, especially in genetic association studies. For example, the inclusion of multiple symptoms within a single model can raise concerns about multicollinearity, while individual SNP-symptom analyses may obscure complex relationships. As such, many traditional statistical approaches often fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of the complexity inherent in many nursing-focused research questions. Multivariate Bayesian approaches offer the unique advantage of allowing researchers to ask questions that are not feasible with traditional approaches. Specifically, these methods support the simultaneous exploration of multiple phenotypes, accounting for the underlying correlational structure between variables, and allow for formal incorporation of existing knowledge into the statistical model. By doing so, they may provide a more realistic view of statistical relationships within a biological system, potentially uncovering new insights into well-established and undiscovered connections, such as the probabilities of association and direct versus indirect effects. This valuable information can help us better understand our phenotypes of interest, leading to more effective nurse-led intervention and prevention programs. To illustrate these concepts, this paper includes an application section covering two specific multivariate Bayesian analysis software programs, bnlearn and mvBIMBAM, with an emphasis on interpretation and extension to nursing research. To complement the paper, we provide access to a detailed online tutorial, including executable R code and a synthetic data set, so the concepts can be more easily extended to other research questions.},
